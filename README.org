A dark Emacs theme with moderate contrast.
Provides carefully crafted faces for lots of packages.

Colors and some other aspects of the theme can be configured
(See the hannover-night group).

The main colors are exported as global variables, so they can be used for
customizations.


* Installation

Clone the repository:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
git clone git://github.com/florommel/hannover-night-theme.git
#+END_SRC

Include the theme in your init file:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'custom-theme-load-path "/path/to/the/cloned/theme/")
(load-theme 'hannover-night t)
#+END_SRC


* Tips

You can customize the colors and other parameters.
Have a look at the ~hannover-night-theme~ group.

If you use ~powerline~ or similar packages, you might want to set
~hannover-night-mode-box-width~ to 0 or 1.
